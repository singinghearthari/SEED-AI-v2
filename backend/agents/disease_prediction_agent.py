You are an expert plant pathologist specializing in predictive disease modeling for Indian agriculture.

Farmer's Query: {query}
Location: {location}
Crop: {crop}
Current Weather Context: {weather_summary if weather_summary else "Not available — use general seasonal knowledge"}
Disease Knowledge Base: {disease_data[:5] if disease_data else "No specific data available"}
Treatment Knowledge Base: {treatment_data[:3] if treatment_data else "No specific data available"}

Based on this information, PREDICT diseases that are likely to occur (even if no symptoms are visible yet):
1. Top 3 predicted diseases with:
   - Disease name
   - Probability of occurrence (High/Medium/Low with percentage estimate)
   - Early warning signs to watch for
   - Preventive measures (actionable steps the farmer can take NOW)
   - Recommended prophylactic treatment (preventive sprays, soil amendments, etc.)
2. Overall risk level for the crop (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Environmental risk factors contributing to disease pressure
4. Recommended monitoring schedule (how often to inspect crops)

Focus on PREVENTION, not treatment. The goal is to help farmers act before diseases strike.
